Description: Library loaded on application initialization by the runtime linker.
 This library fixes the LOCK Prefix issus on the Intel X1000 by over-committing 
 memory. This means that all memory including elf data-segments, CoW memory, 
 ANONYMOUS maps etc are prefaulted on application initialization. This implies higher 
 overall system memory utilization.
